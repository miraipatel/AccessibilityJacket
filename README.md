# AccessibilityJacket
Transformable jacket using Adafruit Circuit Playground

- This project is meant to help those with accessibility concerns. With a temperature sensor, LEDs will utilize different colours given specific parameters: red if above the threshold of temperature, green if in a solid range of temperature, and blue if it is below the given threshold. This will then indiciate the wearer to attach/detach pieces of their outfit if it is too cold or hot. Then using a motion sensor in the back of the jacket, the garment flashes 3 times a bright orange when someone gets too close to indicate to the wearer if someone is behind them. This is extremely useful if the wearer is unaware of what's around them/has hearing concerns that prevent them from knowing there is action behind. Lastly, if the wearer wants to know if there is any noise around them, they have the opportunity to hold a button that will beep with a certain audio threshold and cause the LEDs to blink rapidly in purple. Overall this jacket provides safety, comfort, and offers important accessible features to those may need it.
