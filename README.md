    - 4 yards of Green cotton denim 
    - 4 yards of Green cotton lining fabric
    - 2 yards of interfacing for stiffness
    - Snaps/fasteners for the detachable components
    - Embroidery thread for the snake

    - PIR Sensor 
    - Laptop/lipo battery

- This project is meant to help those with accessibility concerns. With a temperature sensor, LEDs will utilize different colours given specific parameters: red if above the threshold of temperature, green if in a solid range of temperature, and blue if it is below the given threshold. This will then indiciate the wearer to attach/detach pieces of their outfit if it is too cold or hot. Then using a motion sensor in the back of the jacket, the garment flashes 3 times a bright orange when someone gets too close to indicate to the wearer if someone is behind them. This is extremely useful if the wearer is unaware of what's around them to know that there is action behind. Then, if the wearer wants to know if there is any noise around them, they have the opportunity to hold a button that will beep with a certain audio threshold and cause the LEDs to blink rapidly in purple. This is important if the wearer has hearing concerns that prevent them from knowing if someone is talking around them if someone is not directly in their line of vision. Lastly, if the wearer wishes to be part of the conversation but feels as if they will go unnoticed, they have the opportunity to the press the right button which signals "I have something to 'say'!" with a flashing pink. Overall this jacket provides safety, comfort, and offers important accessible features to those who may need it.
